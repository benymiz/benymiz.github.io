        <h3><strong>Low and Slow</strong></h3>
            <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p>
           
            <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
            
            <p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30. </p>

        <img src="images/yaprakes.jpg">
        <h3> Ingredient</h3>
            <p> 1 large jar of grape vine leaves in brine
            <br/ >
                <em>Filling:</em>
                <br/ >
                3 tablespoons olive oil
                <br/ >
                1 onion, diced finely
                <br/ >
                ¼ cup fresh mint, chopped
                <br/ >
                1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped
                <br/ >
                12 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
                <br/ >
                2 cups long grain rice, or long grain and wild rice mix
                <br/ >
                1 teaspoon salt
                <br/ >
                Fresh ground pepper
                <br/ >
                2 cups water
                <br/ >
                ¼ dup dried currants or ½ cup Sultana raisins
                <br/ >
                ½ cup pine nuts toasted, optional
                <br/ >
                1 tablespoon fresh lemon zest
                <br/ >
                <em>Cooking Liquid:</em>
                <br/ >
                2 cups water
                <br/ >
                1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
                <br/ >
                3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <h3> Process</h3>
            <p>Bring a large pan of water to boil, Salt the water, and blanch the fresh vine leaves in the water for 1-2 minutes.  Carefully remove the leaves from the water, taking care not to tear them and drain them for a bit, as they cool off.  Alternatively, if you are using leaves preserved in brine from a jar, carefully remove the leaves from the jar and boil them for 1 minute in unsalted water to remove the brine taste and refresh the jarred leaves.  Drain the leaves.
            <br/ >
            <br/ >
            To make the filling, heat the oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat, add the onion and sauté until translucent.  Season the onion well with salt and pepper.  Next, add the mint, parsley, and cilantro, stir and then add the rice.  Stir for a moment and pour in the water.  Bring the rice to a boil then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.  This amount of water will only cook the rice part way through.  The rice will finish cooking after the vine leaves are stuffed.
            <br/ >
                <br/ >
            Remove the rice from heat.  Add in lemon zest, toasted pine nuts, and dried fruit or raisins.  Let the rice fool off.
            <br/ >
            <br/ >
            Cover the bottom of a heavy skillet or Dutch oven with about 5 grape leaves, pressing about 1 inch up sides of skillet.  Arrange 1 leaf, vein side up, on the work surface.  Place 1-2 rounded tablespoons of rice filling near stem.  Fold in sides, and then roll up jelly roll fashion.  Repeat with remaining filling and leaves. 
            <br/ >
            <br/ >
            Arrange stuffed leaves, seam side down, close together in leaf-lined pan.  I make layers in concentric circles.  Combine the remaining 2 cups of water with lemon juice and olive oil.  Pour this lemon liquid over the layers of grape leaves and cover the whole thing with 5 more unstuffed leaves. Place a lid on the pan.  You can cook these on low heat on the top of the stove after bringing them to a boil and then reducing the heat, or you can bake them in the oven for around 1 and ½ hours at 350º.  Cool completely.
